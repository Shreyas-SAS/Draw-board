<b>Description:</b><br>
it is a smaller version of MS paint with a reduced functionality and drawing based on pixel colour changes. To create this draw pattern a javascript function was used to detect mouse click and change each of the adjescent pixel colour in certain changable radius to the colour set by the user. It was initially intended to create a new learning method for kids under the age of 5 to understand how to write and draw using different colour pallets and pointer devices like mouse, tablet touch or even a strensil.
